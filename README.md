Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize a simple dataset from New York City (NYC). We will create a pivot table to summarize the data and develop interactive bar charts to enhance user engagement and understanding.

Objectives

It starts by finding a simple dataset from New York City. Once we have the dataset, we’ll clean and prepare the data for analysis. Next, we’ll create a pivot table to summarize important information. After that, we’ll develop interactive bar charts to visualize the data. To make it user-friendly, these charts will allow users to click on the bars to see the exact numbers behind them.

Methodology

- Identify and download a dataset from NYC Open Data or similar sources.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and filtering as necessary.
- Use Excel to create a pivot table.
- Create interactive bar charts to visualize the summarized data effectively.
- Implement click functionality on bar charts to display the respective numerical values.
